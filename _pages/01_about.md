A passionate Software Engineer, with a rich skillset and a solid computer science background, I am always thrilled by the opportunity to expand my competencies with new technologies and languages, in order to increase the quality of my products.

Assets: problem-solving and full-stack software development with experience in several high-level programming languages (e.g Java, C#) and scripting tools (e.g. python, tcl/tk). 

Currently employed as a full-stack software engineer at EPFL at the faculty of Science, involved in various important projects, namely the scientific ESA mission INTEGRAL, and the SmartSky research project.
